## ABOUT

My first project with use of *Flask*, *html* and *css (at least styling)*.
The purpose of project was to learn basics of mentioned tools.
<br />

### Program uses two types of ciphering:
<br/>

**1. BINARY** -> takes user input and change each of characters into its bianry representation *(file -> b_coder.py)*
<br />

**2. SHIFT (Caesar)** -> takes user input, change each of characters into its ascii representation and adds to each of them given **shift order** (from range 1 - 10 *default=3*) *(file -> s_coder.py)*
<br />
